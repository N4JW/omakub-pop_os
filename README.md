# Omakub for Pop!_OS

Installs most of the applications included in Omakub while preserving the window tiling, keyboard shortcuts, and overall desktop theme of Pop!_OS. 

This is very much a work in progress. Install at your own risk.

For more information on the original Omakub, visit the website at [omakub.org](https://omakub.org).

## Differences/Goals

I've left out the GNOME extensions. Also this version favors the Brave browser over Google Chrome. VS Code is not installed by default. No attempt is made to change the Pop!_OS background or desktop theme (although I may add that later).
